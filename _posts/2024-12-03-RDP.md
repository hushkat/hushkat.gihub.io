# RDP - TI

This was an interesting challenge on Threat Intelligence. I extracted most of the flag parts from [this](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/10/29/midnight-blizzard-conducts-large-scale-spear-phishing-campaign-using-rdp-files/) website. 

## Instructions
Midnight Blizzard launched a spear-phishing campaign to distribute malicious RDP files. Are you familiar with the signature identified by Microsoft Defender for this campaign ? Additionally, do you know the number of well-known RDP files, number of the sender domain, and the APT designation associated with Midnight Blizzard ?

CYBERGON_CTF2024{Signature_XX_XX_APTXX}

Breaking the question into small parts, we have:

1. Are you familiar with the signature identified by Microsoft Defender for this campaign ?
From the website mentioned at the start of this blog, I found this:

![MSDefender](/assests/images/CyberGon/DefenderSignature.png)
The signature therefore seems to be: `Backdoor:Script/HustleCon.A`

2. Do you know the number of well-known RDP files?
I also found the list of RDP files as shown below:

![RDPfiles](/assests/images/CyberGon/RDP_files.png)
Counting from what has been listed here, we have a total of: `15`

3. Number of the sender domain?
I could also find the sender domains as shown below:
![Domains](/assests/images/CyberGon/Domains.png)
We can count upto: `5`

4. The APT designation associated with Midnight Blizzard?
Looking at the [Mitre ATT&CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/)
![APT29](/assests/images/CyberGon/APT29.png)

With what I have collected so far, the flag construction looks like this:
`CYBERGON_CTF2024{Backdoor:Script/HustleCon.A_15_05_APT29}`
