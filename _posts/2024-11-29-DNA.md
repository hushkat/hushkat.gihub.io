## DNA

The challenge provided this image:
![DNAENCRYPTED](/assets/images/GlacierCTF/DNA.png)

Extracted the string by reading the characters from left to right starting from the top going down. The resulting extracted string from the image: `TCATAGGCTAGCTACACTCGTTGTACACTAGACAGCTACACTCTCTGAAGCTAGCTATGAAGCGTCCTACTCCTATGA`

The challenge also has the following instructions 
`There are some pretty unusual encoding methods. Find the flag PS: Replace spaces with “_”`

From research this seems to be some kind of DNA type of encryption. I also learnt that I need to break the string into 3s, so that made it look like this:

`TCA TAG GCT AGC TAC ACT CGT TGT ACA CTA GAC AGC TAC ACT CTC TGA AGC TAG CTA TGA AGC GTC CTA CTC CTA TGA`

One of my team leads gave me this link that has mappings that could decode the above string. Managed to decode from: https://earthsciweb.org/js/bio/dna-writer/index.html?seq=CGTCTAATCATCTGTAGCGTCGATGACTGA#base_to_text

The resulting string: `CTF DAHOMEY DANS TES GENES`

I then replaced the spaces (" ") with underscores as per the instructions, then embedded the flag prefix to the string.
`NGCCTF{CTF_DAHOMEY_DANS_TES_GENES}`
